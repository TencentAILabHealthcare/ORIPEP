## Quick Start
   To quickly get started with ORIPEP, you can use the provided automation script. Follow these steps:

1. **Run the Automation Script**:
   After setting up the environment and downloading the necessary files, you can run the automation script to start an example task easily.

      ```bash
      python run_oripep.py
      ```
   This will present you with a menu to select from the following options:
   ```
   Welcome to the ORIPEP automation script!

   Please choose an option:
   1. Run PepGPT generation
   2. Run PepRL optimization
   3. Run single prediction in PepAF
   4. Run batch prediction in PepAF
   5. Exit
   Enter your choice (1-5):
   ```

   1. **Run PepGPT generation**
   - Select option 1 will initiate the PepGPT model to generate diverse peptide sequences for a specific target protein. This model leverages language modeling techniques to produce peptide sequences with potential biological activity. If you want to specify parameters such as the input protein sequence, please refer to Further instructions 1.
   ```
   Enter your choice (1-5): 1
   Running command: cd PepGPT && python sample.py

   ```

   2. **Run PepRL optimization**
   - Select option 2 will start the Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization process. This process will optimize the given peptide sequence targeting a specific protein (pdb id) to search better mutated sequences with higher affinity. If you want to specify parameters such as the target protein and the initial peptide sequence, please refer to Further instructions 2.
   ```
   Enter your choice (1-5): 2
   Running command: cd PepRL && sh run.sh
   Target PDB: 7lll_R, Start sequence: QDEEGLLLMQSLEMS
   The current date and time is ...

   Output directory: 
   ./results/7lll_R/QDEEGLLLMQSLEMS
   ```

   3. **Run single prediction in PepAF**
   - Selection option 3 allows you to perform a binding affinity for a given protein and a peptide. If you want to specify parameters such as the target protein and the peptide sequence, please refer to Further instructions 3.
   ```
   Enter your choice (1-5): 3
   Running command: cd PepAF && python predict.py --task single

   ```

   4. **Run batch prediction in PepAF**
   - Selection option 4 allows you to conduct batch predictions for multiple peptide sequences. This is particularly useful when you need to asess a large number of peptide sequences simultaneously. If you want to specify parameters such as the target protein and the peptide sequences, please refer to Further instructions 4.
   ```

## Further Instructions
### 1. Generate New Peptides Using PepGPT

Navigate to the `PepGPT` directory and run the example code:
```bash
cd ORIPEP/PepGPT
python sample.py
```



#### Key Parameter Explanations:
- `--prompt`: The prompt sequence for generating peptides, with a default value of `'MKEQDSEEELIEAFKVFDRDGNGLISAAELRHVMTNLGEKLTDDEVDEMIREADIDGDGHINYEEFVRMMVSK'`.
- `--max_length`: The maximum length of generated sequences, with a default value of `512`.
- `--num_sequences`: The number of sequences to generate, with a default value of `100`. Note that the repeated sequences will only diplay one time.

### 2. Optimize Peptide Mutations Using PepRL and PepAF

Navigate to the `PepRL` directory and run the optimization script:
```bash
cd ORIPEP/PepRL
sh run.sh
```

#### Key Parameter Explanations:
- `PLAYOUT_NUM=20`: The number of rounds for each game.
- `NITER=100`: The number of optimization iterations.
- `WORKDIR='./'`: The working directory.
- `PDBID='7lll_R'`: The PDB ID of the target protein.
- `SEQ='QDEEGLLLMQSLEMS'`: The peptide sequence to be optimized.
- `OUTPUT_DIR="./results/${PDBID}/${SEQ}"`: The directory for output results.

A list of supported PDB IDs can be found in `ORIPEP/PepAF/receptor_data/supported_receptor_pdbid.txt`.

### 3. Predict Protein-Peptide Affinity Using PepAF

A list of supported PDB IDs can be found in `ORIPEP/PepAF/receptor_data/supported_receptor_pdbid.txt`.

Since PepAF requires various features for prediction, we support two approaches to use PepAF:

#### 3.1 Single Protein-Peptide Prediction

Use the built-in feature extraction by specifying the target PDB ID and peptide sequence in `predict.py`:
```bash
cd ORIPEP/PepAF
python predict.py --task single
```

#### 3.2 Batch Calculation for Single Protein and Multiple Peptides

First, navigate to the feature extraction directory and run:
```bash
cd ORIPEP/PepAF/utils/preprocess
sh start.sh
```
You can modify the `target.txt` and `peptide.txt` files to set the target and peptide sequences.

Then, return to the `PepAF` directory and run batch prediction:
```bash
cd ORIPEP/PepAF
python predict.py --task batch
```
